# GW Runs to Perform

## Silicon
* 50% q = 8,8,8.  Try HAWK
* 100% q = 8,8,8. Try HAWK
* 
At which point Si is done.

## ZnO
* 25% for [8,8,5]. To submit
* For 50%, just use the resources used for 100%
  * 6,6,4. 12606
  * 8,8,5. To submit

At which point ZnO is done.
  
## TiO2
* 10% 
  * 6,6,10. 12607. Using same resources as 25%
* 50%
  * 2,2,3. To submit
  * 4,4,6. To submit
  * 6,6,10. To submit

At which point TiO2 is done.

## ZrO2
* Process. Details need adding to notebook

## E1.
* Waiting on ground state

## C1
* Need to try running Andris inputs. Start small (empty states and RGKMAX), go from there.
