# GW Runs to Perform

## Silicon
* 50% q = 8,8,8.

## ZnO
* 25% for [8,8,5]. 13307. From this, can infer the error from [6,6,4] to [8,8,5]
  
## TiO2
* [4,4,6] is essentially converged k-sampling.  
* Run [4,4,6] at 30%, 40% and 50% of total empty states.
* 30 = 13313
* 40 = 13315
* 50 = See how 30 and 40% do

## ZrO2
* Results look entirely consistent
* Could look convergence w.r.t empty states and run [8,8,8]

## E1.
* Waiting on ground state

## C1
* Need to try running Andris inputs. Start small (empty states and RGKMAX), go from there.
