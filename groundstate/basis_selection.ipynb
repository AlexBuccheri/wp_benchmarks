    "Add l channels according to how heavy the element is\n",
    "TODO(Alex). Need some simple rule of thumb for this, based on the atomic number.\n",

    "**Step 2. MT Radii Optimisation**\n",
    "Select muffin tin radii, according to an optimal ratio\n",
    "Run the calculation for some trial energies, with lo recommendations on (rgkmax = 6-7, k-sampling ~ (4,4,4))\n",
    "Look at RHO1D.XML and ensure the minimum of the density is not inside either MT radii.\n",
    "If the largest MT radius is still far from the charge minimum, increase it (and increase the others such that the ratios between MT radii are preserved)\n",

    "**Step 3. Selecting Core and Valence LOs**\n",
